#VCF FILTERING#
#####

#We must filter variant and invariant sites separately -- applying the same filters to all sites would remove invariant sites because of the way they are coded in the file.


#only variant sites. filters on QUALITY, DEPTH, and MISSIGNESS of reads.
#note that exact parameter values should be thought out on analysis-by-analysis basis. This script is for filtering with the eventual goal of generating multiple sequence alignments (phylogenomics!). So, some of the population-genomic filters common at the vcf filtering stage are not helpful here (e.g., filtering on minor allele frequency, HWE proportions, etc.).

#VCFTOOLS
#--min-alleles 2 means there must be at least two alleles (variant)
#--minGQ recode genotypes below GQ [int] as missing. GQ 20 = 1% chance the call is wrong
# meanDP filters remove sites with mean allelic depths outside specified limits [int]
#--minDP recodes any genotypes with fewer than [int] reads as missing
#--minQ filters sites below [int] quality threshold. Q20 = 1% chance there is no variant
#--max-missing removes sites on basis of missing data (1 = no missing data allowed)

#BCFTOOLS
# these commands soft filter variants with QUAL <20 and change GTs to reference sequence
